Description: Computes tau-type estimators for the Principal Fitted Components 
    model and also for reduced rank regression model. Fits multivariate linear
    models, by both robust and maximum likelihood estimators. Performs selection 
    of dimension for sufficient dimension reduction via cross-validation.
